Power is a resource in Screep's that is used in increasing a user's Globasl Power Level by feeding it into a powerSpawn and executing [https://docs.screeps.com/api/#StructurePowerSpawn.processPower](https://docs.screeps.com/api/#StructurePowerSpawn.processPower) at the cost of 50 energy per 1 power. Global Power Level allows you to spawn powerCreeps which have special powers and are considered the hero units of screeps. Power is also a resource that can be sold/bought in the [market](/Market). It is naturally created in PowerBanks which spawn in highway rooms on the map. Global Power Level is determined via `Math.floor(Math.pow((runtimeData.user.power || 0) / C.POWER_LEVEL_MULTIPLY, 1 / C.POWER_LEVEL_POW))` where 'runtimeData.user.power' is your current processed power, and 'C.POWER_LEVEL_MULTIPLY' and 'C.POWER_LEVEL_POW' are constants which can be seen in the [official api](https://docs.screeps.com/api/).

## PowerBanks

Power-banks are structures that spawn in highway rooms and contain power. They exist for 5000 ticks, decaying at a rate of 1 per tick. They will contain some amount of power (randomly) between 500 - 10,000. They have a health of 2,000,000 hits and need to be destroyed to drop the power, which they will in a ruin for 5 ticks, then on the ground subsequent ticks. Attacking a powerBank reflects half of the damage back to the attacking creep.

### Power Harvesting

Power harvesting is action of locating, destroying, and retrieving power from powerBanks. You first need to locate a powerBank in a highway room via creep scout or Observer, then spawn creeps to attack it, and creeps to heal (or however you choose to configure your creeps). You then need to attack the bank till it runs out of HP, once dead, it is wise to have carrier creeps already in position to take the power from the ruin/ground and transport it back to one of your rooms for processing/the market.

## Power Creeps

Power creeps are considered hero units in screeps, they have their own unique look and while they do have ticksToLive of 5000, they are effectively immortal as even if they die they can be respawned after a short cooldown of 8 hours. You create powerCreeps with your Global Power Levels on the manage power creeps section of your overview page, and then spawn them into the world using https://docs.screeps.com/api/#PowerCreep.spawn and a powerSpawn. Their TicksToLive can be extended by using https://docs.screeps.com/api/#PowerCreep.renew targeted at a powerSpawn or powerBank, and they will have a carry capacity & Hit points based on their level. Powercreeps can use a variety of powers which most cost a resource tied to that type of creep. Currently, the operator creep is the only powerCreep released.

When creating/upgrading a powerCreep, you spend GPL to increase the level of its powers. Powers start at level 0 (Meaning the power creep does not have access to them) and can be leveled 1 - 5 which increases the effectiveness of that power. Each level of a power you apply to the powerCreep increases its overall level which starts at 0 (no powers) and goes to level 25. A powerCreep of level 25 can not have any more powers or levels applied to them. As the powerCreep increases in level, its carry capacity and overall hitpoints increases at a rate of 1000 hit points per level and 100 capacity per level. A level 0 power creep starts with 1000 hitpoints and 100 carry capacity. You can only upgrade certain powers to a new level when the powerCreep itself has reached a certain level. This often means that you can not make a pure 1 power creep, as the higher levels of a power requires a high overall powerCreep level.

Its important to note, that removing/deleting a powerCreep from your account costs 1 GPL and takes 24 hours, unless you activate an experimentation period which allows you to delete without a cost instantly for 24 hours. These periods are normally granted during times of new releases (such as when powerCreeps released, or factories) to allow for players to adjust to the new mechanics without penalty. You can only have a maximum of 30 experimentation periods at a time and, there is not set schedule or time that they replenish.
