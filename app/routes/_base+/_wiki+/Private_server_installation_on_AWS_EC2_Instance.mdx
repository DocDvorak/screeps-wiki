## Setup Amazon Web Services EC2 with Node JS

Follow this guide to install Node 6.5.0: http://iconof.com/blog/how-to-install-setup-node-js-on-amazon-aws-ec2-complete-guide/

### Open Ports 21025 â€“ 21028 in AWS Console

- Go to the "Network & Security" -> Security Group settings in the left hand navigation
- Find the Security Group that your instance is using
- Click on Inbound Rules
- Use the drop down and add Custom TCP Rule (port 21025 - 21028)
- Click Apply and enjoy

### Resize your instance:

A m3.medium EC2 instance (1 CPU's and 4GB RAM) or a c4.large (2 CPU's and 4GB RAM) runs the game quickly, while t2.micro was noticeably sluggish. It should be noted that any of the t2 family will run at 20% of normal speed once they run out of "cpu credits", so it is advisable to avoid using them.

- Using AWS Management Console:
- Right-Click on the instance
- Wait...
- Instance Management > Change Instance Type

## Start Screeps Server

In an SSH command window, run the following:

```bash
sudo su
npm install -g screeps
screeps init
nohup screeps start &
```

You will be prompted for your Steam Web API key, you can obtain it on [this page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

### Restarting the Server

If you need to restart your server for some reason, or the process ends, simply re-run the start command:

```bash
sudo nohup screeps start &
```

## Profit!

That's it! Close your SSH connection and exit your terminal. You can now connect to your EC2 instance's IP address @ port 21025 using a Steam client.
