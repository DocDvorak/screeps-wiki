A creep is the main unit of Screeps. They are created from [spawns](/StructureSpawn) and have bodies made of several different parts up to a total of 50. The configuration is entirely up to the user as long as enough [energy](/Energy) is available in the [room](/Map#room) to spawn them. Their role in a colony is entirely dependent on the user, as beyond the body giving different abilities to creep, there is no predefined role for any given configuration.
