## Missing constants (hardcoded in engine)

Knowing "constant worthy" values that do not have a constant set up in the engine yet is important especially now that private servers get more and more modifiable. This list will be useful to users since they can just use values without having to look them up in the engine code, but it might also help request missing constants from the devs (in case changing these currently hardcoded values might make the game more moddable).

| Description | Value | Code sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creep fatigue removal multiplier. It works like this in the engine: newFatigue = Math.max(0, oldFatigue - ( MOVEparts * multiplier)) | -2 | `const MULT_CREEP_FATIGUE_REDUCTION = -2;` |
| Max bucket value. The CPU bucket fills up to 10000 | 10000 | `const MAX_BUCKET = 10000;` |
| Hits (Health/HitPoints) per-part of a creep | 100 | `const CREEP_HITS_PER_PART = 100;` |
| Player username | The name of the account running the code | `const PLAYER_USERNAME = _.find({...Game.structures, ...Game.creeps, ...Game.constructionSites}).owner.username;` |

| Maximum size of a rawMemory total (per shard, 10 active segments) in characters | 10240 | `const MEMORY_RAW_TOTAL_SIZE = 10240;` |
| Hits (Health/HitPoints) per power creep level | 1000 | `const POWER_CREEP_HITS_PER_LEVEL = 1000;` |
| 'value' of plains terrain (Note: absence of value could always be considered a 'plains' since its 0) | 0 | `const TERRAIN_MASK_PLAIN = 0;` |
