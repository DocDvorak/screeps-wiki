## Mineral Harvesting

Minerals can be harvested in any rooms with a mineral and an accompanying extractor present. In rooms with a controller both the controller itself and the extractor need to be owned by yourself to be able to harvest. In rooms without a controller (Center and [Source Keeper](/Source_Keeper) Rooms) anyone can harvest the minerals.
Depending on circumstances players may choose different [harvesting strategies](/Mineral_Mining).

## Boost Production

Minerals can be used to produce [boosts](/Boosts) in [labs](/StructureLab), which can be used to [improve](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Creep-boosts) creeps' parts' efficiency. In general players choose to place their labs close to each other, as their [reactions](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Mineral-compounds) requires the target lab to be within range 2 of both source labs. Placing them effectively lets the player only use the minimum of 2 labs and use the rest (up to 8) for the same reaction, improving lab throughput.
