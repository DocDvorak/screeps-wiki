## Mineral Harvesting

Minerals can be harvested from any room with a mineral and an accessible extractor. In rooms with a controller, both the controller itself and the extractor need to be owned by a player for their creeps to be able to harvest. In rooms with minerals but no controller ([sector center](/Map/#center-sector-room) and [source keeper](/Source_Keeper) rooms), publicly-accessible extractors are always present, so anyone can harvest from them.

Depending on circumstances players may choose different [harvesting strategies](/Mineral_Mining).

## Uses

### Boosts

Minerals can be combined in [labs](/StructureLab) to produce [boosts](/Boosts), which can be used to [improve](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Creep-boosts) creep part effectiveness.

### Commodities

Minerals can also be used in [factories](/StructureFactory):
- Base minerals or ghodium can be combined with energy to produce a compressed form of that mineral
- Compressed minerals can be combined with resources harvested from [deposits](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Harvesting-1) to produce [commodities](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Commodities), which can then be sold to NPCs or other players on the [market](/Market)

### Ghodium

Ghodium is a mineral compound produced by reacting UL and ZK. It can be processed into boosts with additional reactions,
but it can also be used to launch nukes or gain additional safe mode activations.
