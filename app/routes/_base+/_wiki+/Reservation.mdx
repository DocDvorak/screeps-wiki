A reservation is when a creep with claim part(s) uses `reserveController()` on a [controller](/StructureController) in an un-owned [room](/Map#room). A reservation is made by the creep at a rate of one point per claim part and, is lost each game [tick](/Tick) at a rate of one up to a maximum of 5000. The effects of a reservation mean no other players can harvest [sources](/Source) in the room or claim the room for themselves, however it does not stop them from withdrawing or transferring resources from neutral objects such as containers. Sources in the room will also increase their energy from 1500 to 3000 while the reservation is active.

Reservations are commonly used in [Proxy Harvesting](/Proxy_Harvesting) to allow for more energy to be brought of a room, without claiming it. They are also used to stake claims on rooms however, due to the cost of claim parts, this can be very expensive.
