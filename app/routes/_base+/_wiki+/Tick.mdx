A "tick" refers to a single execution of each players' scripts in the game. On the official world, a new tick begins as soon as the last one has finished processing. This means that a tick is not a definite unit of time; they average about 3-4 seconds each, but sometimes take longer. Almost all time in the game is measured in ticks rather than real time; exceptions include novice zones and the leaderboards.

The current tick number can be accessed through `Game.time`. Tick time statistics for the official world are available on the [status page](https://status.screeps.com/).
