OwnedStructure is an in-game class representing a [Structure](/Structure) that has a player name associated with it. It is used in an inheritance chain with such Structures, and inherits from [Structure](/Structure) and [RoomPosition](/RoomPosition) itself.

All structures in the game, with the exception of Roads, Containers and [Constructed Walls](/StructureWall) inherit from this class.

`Game.structures` only includes OwnedStructures that are associated with your player name.
