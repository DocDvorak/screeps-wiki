A [portal](https://docs.screeps.com/api/#StructurePortal) is a special structure that teleports creeps that step on its same [roomPosition](/RoomPosition) to another room. On the MMO, they will randomly appear in a [center room](/Room) and connect to another center room somewhere else on the [map](/Map). In the case of inter-[shard](/Shard) portals, creeps are transported to another shard. Inter-Shard portals are always located in [highway crossroads](/Room), but not ever crossroads has one. When a creep emerges on the target shard, they will have the same name and ticks-to-live but no memory and a different ID.
