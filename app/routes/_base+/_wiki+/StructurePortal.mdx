A [portal](https://docs.screeps.com/api/#StructurePortal) is a special structure that teleports creeps that step on its same [roomPosition](/Map#roomposition) to another room. On the MMO, they will randomly appear in a [center room](/Map#room) and connect to another center room somewhere else on the [map](/Map). In the case of inter-[shard](/Shard) portals, creeps are transported to another shard. Inter-Shard portals are always located in [highway crossroads](/Map#room), but not ever crossroads has one.

When a creep emerges on the target shard, they will have the same name and ticks-to-live but no [memory](/Memory#Memory) and a different ID. If a player already has a creep on a shard with a given name, any of that player's creeps arriving from other shards will be immediately destroyed if they have the same name. [InterShardMemory](https://docs.screeps.com/api/#InterShardMemory) can be used to transfer creep memory across shard boundaries, check for name conflicts, etc.
