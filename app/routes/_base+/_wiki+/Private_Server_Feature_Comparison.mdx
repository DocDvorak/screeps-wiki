| Market | ✔️ | 🔬 | [screepsmod-market](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-market) | Is this an alternate code, or the same as official? |
| Room History | ✔️ | ✔️ | [screepsmod-history](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-history) | Warning: Currently with AWS mode this produces a lot of PUT requests, this can easily become very expensive. For that reason, AWS mode is currently not recommended |
| Authentication | ✔️ | ✔️ | [screepsmod-auth](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth) | This adds user/pass auth to the screeps private server |
| Database | ✔️ | ✔️ | [screepsmod-mongo](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-mongo) | Replace LokiJS with MongoDB and Redis, loki should not be used for public private servers, official runs with mongo and redis |
