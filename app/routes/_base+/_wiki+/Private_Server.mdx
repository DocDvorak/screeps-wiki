## Modules

The private server consists of several modules that work together to provide the game environment.

### Launcher

The server launch process consists of multiple parallel processes linked to each other. There are different types of launchers available:

- **GUI Launcher**: This launcher comes with the standard version of the game on Steam. It provides a GUI for managing the server, viewing server logs, and a CLI interface to control the server. However, it can be cumbersome to modify and update and is not the preferred way to manage a server.
- **Console Launcher**: Allows launching the server from a command line without the GUI. Prerequisites include Node 10, Python 2, and build tools.
- **Custom Launchers**: Users can create their own launchers to manage server processes.

These are the community preferred solutions for hosting a private server:

- [Screepers Launcher](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-launcher): developed by the community to streamline the launch process and offer additional features for managing the private server.
- [Jomik's Screeps Server](https://github.com/Jomik/screeps-server): focuses on ease of use and simplicity. It leverages Docker to provide a containerized environment, simplifying deployment and administration.

### Storage

Contains a LokiJS-based database, a key-value storage, and a Pub/Sub mechanism. It stores game data, including map and player data.

### Backend

Includes an HTTP server for client access and a CLI server for administration. Administrators can execute commands and interact with mods.

### Engine

The game core responsible for executing game scripts and interacting with game world objects.

### Driver

Acts as a link between the environment-independent engine and the immediate hosting environment. Users can replace this module for customized data handling.

### Common

A shared code base with useful utilities.
