Sources are where all energy comes into the game. Sources come with three different levels of energy-

- 4000 energy for [Source Keeper](/Source_Keeper) rooms.
- 3000 energy for claimed or reserved rooms.
- 1500 energy for all other rooms.

Once a source drops below it's full capacity in energy it starts a 300 tick cooldown. At the end of that period the source is refreshed. Since the timer does not begin until energy has been taken from the source it is important not to let a full source sit idle.
