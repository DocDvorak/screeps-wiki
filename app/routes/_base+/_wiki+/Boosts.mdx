Boosts are [mineral](/Minerals) compounds that are applied to [creeps](/Creep) to make them faster, tougher, or more efficient. They are created and applied using a [lab](/StructureLab), costing 30 minerals and 20 [energy](/Energy) per body [part](/Parts) boosted. Each body part can only receive one boost, but different body parts in a creep may receive different boosts. Boosts are removed if the creep is renewed.

Boosts are organized into [three tiers](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Mineral-compounds), each increasing in effectiveness. Base compounds are also required for some boosts; these are compounds that are not single minerals, but are also not boosts.

Tier 1 compounds are created by combining base minerals with hydrogen or oxygen. Tier 2 compounds are created by combining tier 1 compounds with hydroxide, a base compound. Tier 3 compounds, the most expensive, are created by combining tier 2 compounds with the somewhat rare mineral Catalyst (X). The full list of reactions can be found over at the official docs' resource page's [boost](https://docs.screeps.com/resources.html#Creep-boosts) section, and an in-game object representing the possible reactions can be found with the global variable `REACTIONS`.

Boosts can provide many advantages to creeps; for example, a creep with 17 HEAL parts, each boosted with tier 3 compound, can outheal tower damage at point-blank range. XGH20 is generally considered the most valuable, since it allows creeps to upgrade controllers twice as fast without using more energy.
