A structure is a buildable object. All buildings start out as a [construction site](/ConstructionSite), which can be built by a creep using `Creep.build()`.

All structures have a number of hitpoints. [Ramparts](/StructureRampart) and [constructed walls](/StructureWall) start at 1 hitpoint and must be repaired. Most structures, however, have max hit points as soon as they are built.
